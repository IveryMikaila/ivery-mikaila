        Hi, I’m Mikaila Ivery (also known by Mynk), welcome to my portfolio!  I’m a multifaceted creative who is passionate about writing, fine arts, and web development. I believe were all worth more than our job titles or what we do. We should see one another as human beings rather than cogs in a machine and I’m passionate about bringing this mentality to whichever team I join. I currently work as a Freelance Front-end Developer for Boy Blondey and Orèe Nyc based in Brooklyn, New York. My favorite way to pass time includes scrolling through Dribble to find web designs then bringing the design to life through the means of Javascript. 
        <br/>

        My favorite Javascript libraries are definitely React Js and Green Sock Animation Platform (GSAP). There's just something about playing with an animated button and scroll-based animations that excite the child in me. I also enjoy CSS, as most developers don’t understand how powerful this stylesheet language is. In regard to my personal life, I’m a devoted follower of Jesus Christ and am proud to force my religion on everyone I encounter. Okay, I’m just joking.I’m not one of the annoying Christians who don’t respect people’s boundaries. However, if you’re interested in learning about who Jesus is don’t hesitate to send me an email! I’ll just leave this scripture here (in case you’re interested) Psalms 136:2 NIV “ 2 Give thanks to the God of gods. His love endures forever.”
